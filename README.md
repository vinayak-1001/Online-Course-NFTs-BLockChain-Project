# **Online Course Access Smart Contract**

## **Description**

The **OnlineCourseAccess** Move module is designed to manage online course enrollments directly on the Aptos blockchain without relying on NFTs or complex token standards.
It allows course creators to store course information and maintain a secure on-chain list of students who have been granted access.

---

## **Vision**

Our vision is to provide a **lightweight, blockchain-based course management system** that ensures:

* Transparent ownership of courses
* Secure, verifiable student access records
* Minimal dependencies for compatibility with older Aptos framework versions

This approach is ideal for educational platforms, independent instructors, and e-learning systems that want to leverage blockchain without high complexity.

## **Future Scope**

1. **NFT Integration** – Upgrade to use Aptos NFTs to represent course ownership/access when framework compatibility allows.
2. **Access Verification API** – Add public read-only functions for platforms to quickly check student access.
3. **Course Metadata** – Store extended details like syllabus, duration, and prerequisites.
4. **Payments & Monetization** – Integrate Aptos Coin payments for automated course purchases.
5. **Multi-Course Management** – Allow creators to manage multiple courses under one account.
